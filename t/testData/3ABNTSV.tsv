15-05-2023	11:00:00	00:58:30	GOD: FACT OR FICTION? - WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE	Scripture calls us to rest in God’s love and care each Sabbath. Sabbath is a symbol of rest, not works; of grace, not legalism; of assurance, not condemnation, of depending upon God, not upon ourselves. Join us this week to see how the central issue during the last days of earth’s history is who we worship and why the Sabbath is crucial to that worship.
15-05-2023	12:00:00	00:58:30	BEHOLD THE LAMB PRESENTS	“If God be for us” are words that will remind us of the Father’s everlasting love towards us, His children. God emptied all of Heaven in the gift of His son, Christ Jesus. In Christ’s ascension back to Heaven, He promised to send the gift of a Comforter, the Holy Spirit. The purpose of this three-fold gift of Heaven on earth, is to save mankind from the snares of the enemy. A godly man filled with the hope of this promise once said, “The Best of All Is, God Is With Us.” But we must continue in the faith IF Heaven is to be our home! We need to use the Word of God as the distinguisher of Truth and error and learn daily to stand firm in its precepts and promises! We have nothing to fear unless we forget God’s leading in the past! So join Pastor Kenny & Chris Shelton as they present, “The Best of All Is, God Is With Us!”

With her gone, he doubts the value of his perfect biceps, triceps, and quads, yet can’t seem to let himself be a normal person. His psychiatrist prescribed an SSRI drug, but it did little good. A few weeks into counseling the psychiatrist prescribed Vivanse for ADD and it revolutionized William’s life. He said he could focus for the first time in years and was starting to actually be able to have conversations with people. What was going on with William?

God emptied all of Heaven in the gift of His son, Christ Jesus. In Christ’s ascension back to Heaven, He promised to send the gift of a Comforter, the Holy Spirit. The purpose of this three-fold gift of Heaven on earth, is to save mankind from the snares of the enemy. A godly man filled with the hope of this promise once said, “The Best of All Is, God Is With Us.” But we must continue in the faith IF Heaven is to be our home! We need to use the Word of God as the distinguisher of Truth and error and learn daily to stand firm in its precepts and promises! We have nothing to fear unless we forget God’s leading in the past! So join Pastor Kenny & Chris Shelton as they present, “The Best of All Is, God Is With Us!”

However, Jesus is the God of both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The stories of the anti–deluvians, Sodom, and Jericho, are only three of the many stories in the Old Testament that show the grace of God. It is important that we understand God’s unchanging character, which especially matters to those of us living in the last days.

And our human insignificance, our powerlessness and deficiency... we are so small, sinners to the full extent. We need Christ, and He will help us if we let go - if we leave alone and behind what's preventing us from going to the next level with Him. Our salvation is through Christ only, not through what we do or don't do. We just have to want it, and leave the rest to Him.

They are professedly serving God, but they are more earnestly serving mammon. This half-and-half work is a constant denying of Christ, rather than a confessing of Christ. So many have brought into the church their own unsubdued spirit, unrefined; their spiritual taste is perverted by their own immoral, debasing corruptions, symbolizing the world in spirit, in heart, in purpose, confirming themselves in lustful practices, and are full of deception through and through in their professed Christian life. Living as sinners, claiming to be Christians! Those who claim to be Christians and will confess Christ should come out from among them and touch not the unclean thing, and be separate. ...” {Christian Service, p 41.1} Examine yourself.

And our human insignificance, our powerlessness and deficiency... we are so small, sinners to the full extent. We need Christ, and He will help us if we let go - if we leave alone and behind what's preventing us from going to the next level with Him. Our salvation is through Christ only, not through what we do or don't do. We just have to want it, and leave the rest to Him.

The Rabbis haughty pride turned to hatred and anger towards Him; even to the point that they sought to arrest Christ and plot to put Him to death! Yet many who heard Him speak believed in Him and desired the Living Water and the Bread of Life that He was offering. Through the life of Christ, we are shown the extremity to which the enemy of souls will go in order to stop the saving Truth of Heaven from being revealed to mankind. Yet, we are called to sound the alarm in Zion! To give the 3-Angel’s message with a loud, clear, and distinct voice. “If God be for us, who can be against us”?

The Rabbis haughty pride turned to hatred and anger towards Him; even to the point that they sought to arrest Christ and plot to put Him to death! Yet many who heard Him speak believed in Him and desired the Living Water and the Bread of Life that He was offering. Through the life of Christ, we are shown the extremity to which the enemy of souls will go in order to stop the saving Truth of Heaven from being revealed to mankind. Yet, we are called to sound the alarm in Zion! To give the 3-Angel’s message with a loud, clear, and distinct voice. “If God be for us, who can be against us”?

03-06-2023	01:30:00	00:28:30	ETERNAL TRUTHS MATTER	All of history is moving to one grand, glorious climax: the coming of Jesus. Soon the great controversy between good and evil will be over. Soon sin and suffering will end. Soon disaster, disease, and death will be no more. Soon peace, joy, and love will replace all our sorrows and our tears will be wiped away forever. In this inspiring presentation, Pastor Finley shares that Jesus wants you in heaven even more than you want to be there. Eternity lies before us and there is no more important decision to respond to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and yield to the appeal of grace.

This is a science of unlearning to relearn, of suffering to be strong, (AA, 467). It’s a science of going deeper in our Father and of falling deeply in love with Him, of demonstrating faith in the life because of love, demonstrating His forgiveness and mercy toward us because of love. Maybe, just maybe then, we can hasten His glorious return… Join us now to learn more!

White Horse Media’s 7-part series explores the peril and power of money, laziness, working, eliminating debt, saving, tithes and offerings, investing vs. gambling, retirement, and earth’s final crisis when “no man can buy or sell save he that has the mark.” Revelation 13:17. Based on Scripture and practical wise principles.

04-06-2023	05:30:00	00:28:30	EVOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE	One of the key ideas in evolution is that there is a fairly smooth transition from one species of animal to another. So, there should have been a whole lot of animals in between fish and reptiles, and similarly between dinosaurs and birds. This should mean that there are lot of fossils of these intermediate animals. The question is—do these fossils exist? It feels like a little bit of a detective story, looking for the links in the chain. How does the evolutionary process work and why would we be looking for these fossils in the middle between different animals? Find out in this program.

Scotland would follow after the teachings of John Calvin more due to the huge influence that John Knox, a student of Calvin would have.

06-06-2023	13:00:00	00:28:30	MULTITUDE OF COUNSELORS	Joseph Strong, a very tall 53 year-old retired policeman of Irish descent, strides into the office and warmly says hello in a deep bass voice. He sits down in the chair and begins to explain his situation, immediately melting into tears that continue to flow for most of the session. He explains that he can’t control his temper, and then can’t shake the feelings of despair that linger after he explodes. For instance, he exploded when a neighbor insulted his dog, but immediately regretted losing his temper. Now he feels deep shame and remorse and wants to learn anger management.

06-06-2023	14:45:00	00:14:45	INTIMATE CLARITY	Humanity started out naked and not ashamed, but the fall led to our enduring sense of body shame. While covering our bodies is appropriate, extreme shame of our physical self is unhealthy. In marriage, we recover that naked-and-not-ashamed experience, which symbolizes our spiritual intimacy with God.

06-06-2023	17:00:00	00:28:30	EVOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE	One of the key ideas in evolution is that there is a fairly smooth transition from one species of animal to another. So, there should have been a whole lot of animals in between fish and reptiles, and similarly between dinosaurs and birds. This should mean that there are lot of fossils of these intermediate animals. The question is—do these fossils exist? It feels like a little bit of a detective story, looking for the links in the chain. How does the evolutionary process work and why would we be looking for these fossils in the middle between different animals? Find out in this program.

06-06-2023	21:00:00	00:58:00	BEHOLD THE LAMB PRESENTS	“A Manufactured Religion” may be popular, enjoyable, and even meaningful at times. But if our religion is NOT built and firmly grounded on the Rock, Jesus Christ, as taught in the Holy Bible, at the end of our life, we will find that it was nothing but sinking sand! This may be a shock to many, but the Devil is working within and without, the churches of our day as he has done in past ages. “A Manufactured Religion” is just another SNARE of the enemy that we MUST be aware of and pray earnestly NOT to fall victim to! So, tune in and study along with Pastor Kenny & Chris Shelton as they bring you this timely message.

07-06-2023	01:30:00	00:27:30	THE CREATOR REVEALED	Living things provide abundant evidence of their relatively recent creation. Claims that life, and death, are billions of years old exploit the fact that we can’t do time travel to see if they are true. All we can do is consider the record of the past we have in God’s Word and in His creation. Join us as we examine just a little of the clear evidence that life on Earth is thousands rather than millions of years old.

07-06-2023	10:00:00	00:55:00	3ABN AUSTRALIA HOMECOMING	Although largely overlooked by many who read the Bible, the sanctuary is at the very heart of the Scriptures. Every truth that is necessary for our salvation is found within the sanctuary. Through types and symbols, God communicated to His people in ancient Israel how He would save them from their sins. As we study the sanctuary in the light of what Jesus has done, and is doing, we see the truth and the beauty of the gospel more clearly. This cannot but draw our hearts closer and closer to Jesus.

In this thought-provoking message, she defines legalists as being outside of God’s plan of salvation by grace through the faith of Jesus, because legalism depends on self-righteousness obtained by works. Shelley shares the solution Christ prescribed in humbling ourselves, and learning to depend on God.

The beast power of Revelation 13, the little horn in Daniel 7, and the “son of perdition”in 2 Thessalonians all speak of a power that usurps God’s authority and introduces a counterfeit system of worship, while using force and coercion to compel allegiance.

12-06-2023	11:00:00	00:58:30	3ABN SABBATH SCHOOL PANEL	The “mark of the beast” prophecy is about the final link in an ungodly chain of religious persecution that goes back through the ages. Like the persecutions of the past, it is designed to force everyone to conform to a certain set of counterfeit beliefs and a counterfeit system of worship of the beast power.
12-06-2023	12:00:00	00:58:30	BEHOLD THE LAMB PRESENTS	Some people have the belief that everyone will go to Heaven regardless of their deeds. But is this what the Bible teaches? Why would Christ refer to the “Judgment” if it was of little consequence? It’s because the judgment of God is certainly no laughing matter! It is very serious! It is a subject that we need to put more study time into. In a real sense, we are all on probation. We’ve all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. What must we do to be saved? How may our Heavenly records of sin be blotted out by the blood of the Lamb? Join Pastor Kenny and Chris Shelton as they look deeper into this message, “The Judgment Was Set, the Books Opened.”

He talks enthusiastically about his faith, but by the third or forth session you notice he has some extreme ideas regarding what the Bible teaches about spiritual gifts. By the fifth session, Tony tells you that he believes you are a prophet, and that Gabriel the archangel has spoken to him, telling him that the two of you have a special mission to fulfill in giving the last message to a dying world.

14-06-2023	10:00:00	00:54:45	3ABN AUSTRALIA HOMECOMING	One of Satan’s greatest end-time deceptions is to convince the Christian world that it is no longer necessary to keep God’s law. The Cross of Christ, far from being the reason that the Law has been done away with, is an unanswerable argument to the immutability and righteousness of the law. The central issue in the Last Days’ final crisis that divides the world over loyalty or rebellion to God, is the issue of worshipping God according to His Commandments. Only those who correctly understand the Cross of Christ and keep the commandments of God, will be prepared to meet Jesus when He returns.

It is a subject that we need to put more study time into. In a real sense, we are all on probation. We’ve all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. What must we do to be saved? How may our Heavenly records of sin be blotted out by the blood of the Lamb? Join Pastor Kenny and Chris Shelton as they look deeper into this message, “The Judgment Was Set, the Books Opened.”
